## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If I notice anything that we'd like changed, I will ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that I can merge it.
